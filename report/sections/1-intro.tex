\subsection{Programming languages and compilers in general}
TODO: Give a short description of a compiler.


Programming languages are the means for programmers to express what the machine should compute, or in other words: What a program should do.
The two main divisions between programming languages are likely whether they are High- or Low-level and which `programming paradigm' they follow (in the next section these paradigms will be shortly described).

The low-level languages are close to what the computer `natively` understand, which is machine code/instructions, but are harder for humans to read and write. Examples hereof are FOTRAN and COBOL. Usually high-level languages are used for faster development, better readability and maintenance, among other things. Thus it is of general interest... SOMETHING SOMETHING


TODO: Describe paradigms in the next subsection

A programming language is implemented via a compiler

\subsection{Functional programming languages}
TODO: Give a short description of functional languages.


Terms to be described:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expressions
\item Higher order functions
\item Partial application
\item Currying
\item No mutable state
\item Not using statements (i.e. no side effects)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The problem}
In short, we want to make our own functional programming language, Kite, by implementing a compiler.


Kite will feature the basic elements of most functional languages (described above), and a few additional features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Static typing and thus typechecking
\item Closures
\item If-expressions (not to be confused with if-statements)

\end{itemize}
