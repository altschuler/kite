TODO: Give a short description of a compiler.

\subsection{Functional programming languages}
TODO: Give a short description of functional languages.

Terms to be described:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expressions
\item Higher order functions
\item Partial application
\item Currying
\item No mutable state
\item Not using statements (i.e. no side effects)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The problem}
In short, we want to make our own functional programming language, Kite, by implementing a compiler.


Kite will feature the basic elements of most functional languages (described above), and a few additional features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Static typing and thus typechecking
\item Closures
\item If-expressions (not to be confused with if-statements)

\end{itemize}
