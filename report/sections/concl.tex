ze problem:

The goal of this project is to gain knowledge in a field which we have only little prior knowledge about, as we at the beginning of this project have not had any formal education within the subject. In short, we strive to get a good understanding of the concepts of functional programming and compilation of programming languages in general. We will achieve this by implementing a compiler for a functional language named Kite.
