We have fulfilled our initial goal of gaining a substantial comprehension of compilers and functional languages in general. This was achieved through comprehensive planning, several iterations of designing and finally implementing the Kite programming language.

In conclusion, we are glad we achieved a much better understanding of compilers and in functional languages. In regards of compilers, these are an essential part of computers, and as aspiring software engineers, we ought to be familiar with the different aspects of computing. As of functional languages, we believe these will play a larger rule in the future, mainly due to the inherent ease of maintainability and concurrency. Concurrency is an important aspect of the future as the clock frequency of CPUs are unlikely to increase with silicon based chips, but the transistor and core count is fortunately still increasing.

Looking forward, Kite still lacks a few features before being a fully fledged, practically useful language. Namely, the construction of custom data types, a backend emitting LLVM and fully functional pattern matching. We have also looked at how this could potentially be solved through further development.
